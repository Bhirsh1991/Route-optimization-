# Route Optimization

This repository contains a simple HTML page for planning optimized routes.

## CI

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run a small test script via GitHub Actions. The workflow runs `test.sh` which checks that `index.html` exists and contains a `<title>` tag.

You can run the same test locally before opening a pull request:

```bash
bash test.sh
```
